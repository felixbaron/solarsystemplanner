# SolarSystemPlanner

SolarSystemPlanner is a Python library that helps you to realize your photovoltaic system and become independent of carbon energy.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install SolarSystemPlanner.

```bash
pip install solarsystemplanner
```

## Usage

I recommend to follow the flow in the [Juypter notebook](notebook.ipynb). You can implement the framework alternatively in a web frontend. Feel free to share your completed project in this README file.
